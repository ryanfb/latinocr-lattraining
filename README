Source files for some automatically generated parts of the
Latin (lat) training for Tesseract OCR. Specifically, this contains
the Makefile and its prerequisites to build the following files
needed for the lat training:

- training_text.txt
- lat.word.txt
- lat.freq.txt
- lat.unicharambigs
- lat.wordlist


# Dependencies

# To build the training parts

Note that the build starts by downloading and unpacking a text
corpus from which to generate the wordlists.

Make all of the parts with the command:
  make
