Source files for some automatically generated parts of the Ancient
Latin (lat) training for Tesseract OCR. Specifically, this contains
the Makefile and its prerequisites to build the following files
needed for the lat training:

- training_text.txt
- lat.word.txt
- lat.freq.txt
- lat.unicharambigs
- lat.wordlist


# Dependencies

On a Mac with homebrew, install coreutils and gnu-sed (needed for
gsed, gmktemp, gshuf).

# To build the training parts

Note that the build starts by downloading and unpacking a text
corpus from which to generate the wordlists.

Make all of the parts with the command:
  make
